-- `Posn' records the location of a token in the input text.  It has three
-- fields: the address (number of chacaters preceding the token), line number
-- and column of a token within the file. `start_pos' gives the position of the
-- start of the file and `eof_pos' a standard encoding for the end of file.
-- `move_pos' calculates the new position after traversing a given character,
-- assuming the usual eight character tab stops.
